# Adder
Adder is a small but usable subset of the Python language writen in Haskell. It is named for the Blackadder comedy series, much as the Python language is named for Monty Python. 


My Contribution:
  Adding to the interpreter, syntax, and parser files to support an IfStmt (If Statement) and IfExp (If Expression).
